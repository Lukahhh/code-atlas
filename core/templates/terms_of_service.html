                        <h3>2. Use Licence</h3>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials (information or software) on Django
                                Notebook's website for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a licence, not a
                                transfer of title, and under this licence you may not:
                                <ol type="i">
                                    <li>modify or copy the materials;</li>
                                    <li>use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial);
                                    </li>
                                    <li>attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained on Django Notebook's website;</li>
                                    <li>remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or</li>
                                    <li>transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>This licence shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by
                                Django Notebook at any time. Upon terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the termination of this
                                licence, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession whether in electronic or printed format.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <h3>3. Disclaimer</h3>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>The materials on Django Notebook's website are provided on an 'as is' basis. Django Notebook makes no
                                warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without
                                limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or
                                non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights.</li>
                            <li>Further, Django Notebook does not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results,
                                or reliability of the use of the materials on its website or otherwise relating to such materials or on any
                                sites linked to this site.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h3>4. Limitations</h3>
                        <p>In no event shall Django Notebook or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages
                            for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the
                            materials on Django Notebook's website, even if Django Notebook or a Django Notebook authorised representative has
                            been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow
                            limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these
                            limitations may not apply to you.</p>
                        <h3>5. Accuracy of materials</h3>
                        <p>The materials appearing on Django Notebook's website could include technical, typographical, or photographic errors.
                            Django Notebook does not warrant that any of the materials on its website are accurate, complete or current. Django
                            Notebook may make changes to the materials contained on its website at any time without notice. However Django
                            Notebook does not make any commitment to update the materials.</p>
                        <h3>6. Links</h3>
                        <p>Django Notebook has not reviewed all of the sites linked to its website and is not responsible for the contents of
                            any such linked site. The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by Django Notebook of the site. Use of
                            any such linked website is at the user's own risk.</p>
                        <h3>7. Modifications</h3>
                        <p>Django Notebook may revise these terms of service for its website at any time without notice. By using this website
                            you are agreeing to be bound by the then current version of these terms of service.</p>
                        <h3>8. Governing Law</h3>
                        <p>These terms and conditions are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of UK and you irrevocably submit
                            to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in that State or location.</p>
